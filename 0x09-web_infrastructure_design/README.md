## Project Concepts
	- DevOps  SysAdmin  Web infrastructure

### Project Description
This project involves the design and implementation of web infrastructure, including simple web stacks, distributed web infrastructure, and secured and monitored web infrastructure.

#### Simple Web Stack

**A simple web stack** is a basic set of software components that are used to serve web pages. It typically consists of a web server, a database server, and a programming language. Some popular examples of simple web stacks include:

- LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP)
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
- WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
- Distributed Web Infrastructure

### Concepts Covered in the Project

**A distributed web infrastructure** is a web infrastructure that is spread across multiple servers. This allows for greater scalability and performance, as well as improved reliability. Some common components of a distributed web infrastructure include:

**Load balancers:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.

**Caches:** Store frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the database server.

**Content delivery networks (CDNs):** Deliver static content from servers that are located close to the user, to improve performance and reduce bandwidth costs.
Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

**A secured and monitored web infrastructure** is a web infrastructure that is protected from security threats and monitored for performance and availability. Some common security measures include:

**Firewalls:** Filter incoming and outgoing traffic to block malicious traffic.

**Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

**Web application firewalls (WAFs):** Protect web applications from common attacks.

### Whiteboarding the Infrastructure Design

Whiteboarding the infrastructure design is a process of sketching out the design of the web infrastructure on a whiteboard. This helps to visualize the overall design and identify any potential problems. Some of the key considerations when whiteboarding the infrastructure design include:

- The type of web application or website that will be hosted on the infrastructure.
- The expected traffic load.
- The required performance and reliability.
- The budget.
Once the infrastructure design has been whiteboarded, it can be implemented using a variety of tools and technologies.

### Additional Information

In addition to the above, here is some additional information that can be considered when designing and implementing web infrastructure:

- **Scalability:** The infrastructure should be designed to be scalable, so that it can handle increased traffic load without sacrificing performance.
- **Reliability:** The infrastructure should be designed to be highly reliable, with minimal downtime.
- **Security:** The infrastructure should be designed to be secure, with protection against common security threats.
- **Performance:** The infrastructure should be designed to deliver high performance, with low response times.
- **Cost:** The infrastructure should be designed to be cost-effective, while still meeting the other requirements.
